# Web-Development-Portfolio

## A fully functional Portfolio written in HTML and CSS showing a short description about me and the projects I have completed so far in my career.

This project is a portfolio on my web development career so far. The project was made from fresh code to show how to create a unique and personal portfolio using the following in HTML and CSS:

* Create a loadable portfilio
* When it is loadable you can see my name, a photo of me, and links about me, my work, and how to contact me.
* When using the navigation bar you will be directed to each corresponding section that you click on.
* If you look in "My Work" and click on an image you will be directed to projects that I have completed throughout my career.
